## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

Manipulating DOM using Javascript. Traversing through elements using javascript. Storing items to localstorage and fetching to display it to the website.

### Continued development

Have to optimise code. This code has lots of code repetition. Have to fix that in future.
